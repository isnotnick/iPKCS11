        <h1>iPKCS11</h1>
        <p>This project aims to makes it possible to use an iPhone for storing private keys used in programs such as SSH. It communicates with the computer over HTTPS and connects to SSH with the PKCS11 protocol.</p>

        <h3>Store all your keys on your iPhone.</h3>

        <p>Imagine you have generated a new keypair with ssh-keygen and you have got an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file in your ~/.ssh directory. Let's assume you chosed to protect your private key with a passphrase (otherwise any program that have access to your disk can steal the key and login all servers you have put your public on). Now suppose your computer is getting compromised and someone gets access to the whole system, even your keyboard. Your private key is smoked and the consequences could be disastrous. Let's come up with a solution.</p>

        <p>What if all keys where stored on an iPhone and the ssh command could talk to the phone over a common protocol. It could then ask the phone to sign a message with the private key and send the signed message back. In that way, the private keys would never have to leave the phone and the app could even show a message to the user and ask for permission. This is what iPKCS is all about.

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/demute/iPKCS11.git
</code></pre>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>ssh let you specify a PKCS11-compatible module with the <pre>-I</pre> option, so run it with <pre>-I ./iPKCS11.so<pre>. This module wraps the needed functions into JSON code which is sent over an HTTPS link to a listening server (the server URL and the SSL certificate is read from config files in your homedir). Now, practically any HTTPS server can be built and currently a perl server exist to demonstrate how the PKCS11 protocol is wrapped to JSON. The iPhone app is yet to be written).</p>
